### Information Collection
The **Nuvii** app was developed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or process any personal or sensitive user data. This means we do not request or store information such as name, email address, location, or any other personally identifiable information.

### Security
Although the **Nuvii** app does not collect personal information, we are committed to ensuring that your experience with the app is secure. We employ best security practices during the development of the app to prevent vulnerabilities and protect against potential cyber threats. However, it is important to note that no system is completely immune to security breaches, and complete protection cannot be guaranteed. We encourage users to keep their devices updated with the latest software versions and to use appropriate protective measures, such as secure passwords and safe internet connections.

### User Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the user to ensure the security of the device used to access **Nuvii**. This includes protecting the device from unauthorized access, installing apps from trusted sources, and maintaining a safe browsing environment. **Nuvii** is not responsible for any damages resulting from security breaches outside the control of the application, such as vulnerabilities in the operating system or malware installed on the device.

### Children's Privacy
The **Nuvii** app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take immediate steps to delete such information from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child may have used our service inappropriately, please contact us immediately.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy at any time. Any significant changes will be communicated through updates in the app or via other appropriate channels. We recommend that users review this policy periodically to stay informed about any changes.

The latest version of this Privacy Policy will always be available on this page, and any changes will take effect immediately after being posted.
